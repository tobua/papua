# Progressive Web App papua Template

Template to get you started with a PWA. Demo application includes a Manifest, Service Worker and uses IndexedDB to store data between sessions. Due to compatibility issues with `workbox-webpack-plugin` and Rspack this setup still relies on the `webpack` version of this plugin.

## Installation

```
npm init now papua ./my-pwa pwa
```

## Demo
