# Progressive Web App papua Template

Template to get you started with a PWA. Demo application includes a Manifest, Service Worker and uses IndexedDB to store data between sessions. Due to compatibility issues with `workbox-webpack-plugin` and Rspack this setup uses [inject-manifest-plugin](https://npmjs.com/inject-manifest-plugin) custom built to work with Rspack as well as webpack.

## Installation

```
npm init now papua ./my-pwa pwa
```
